# Catch the Objects - Invader Game
### 🎮🚀 Welcome to Catch the Objects - an arcade-style game built using Pygame! In this game, you control a paddle to catch falling objects. The goal is simple: catch as many blue objects as you can while avoiding red objects. Let's dive in and have some fun!

## Gameplay
🕹️ Use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle left and right.
🔵 Catch blue objects to increase your score.
🔴 Avoid red objects. If you catch a red object, you lose a life. Lose all lives, and it's game over.
